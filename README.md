# Expring
This is the beginning of a web-application based on [Spring](https://spring.io/). The first feature will be to save expenses to a database. One expense has the fields
* Amount
* Description
* Date
* Category

where the category should be chosen from a given list. 

# TODO
* Write tests for already existing code
* Maybe use port 8443 instead of 443
* Make the SSL not self-signed
* Redirect http to https [hint1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26655875/spring-boot-redirect-http-to-https)
* Implement security with username, password, individual databases etc
