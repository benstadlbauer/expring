# Expring
This is the beginning of a web-application based on [Spring](https://spring.io/). I have had this idea for a long
 time and after some local console-based applications I decided to make this a web-application. This way I can access
  this programm easily from my phone and from my desktop computer.

The first and only feature so far is to save expenses to a database. One expense has the following properties:

* **Description** of the expense, e.g. "Coffee",
* **Amount**,
* **Date** of spending and
* **Category** of the expense, e.g. "Groceries" or "Rent".

# TODO
* Implement security with username, password, individual databases etc
* Write tests for already existing code

# Ideas for further features
* Implement sub-categories
* Implement a dark-mode
* Make "Expring" text in webpage with Vollkorn typeface
