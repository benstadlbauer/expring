== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

# Abandoned!
I decided to use another backend framework for my application. I'm doing some research right now and I will put a new repository on github soon. 
# Expring
This is the beginning of a web-application based on [Spring](https://spring.io/). I have had this idea for a long
 time and after some local console-based applications I decided to make this a web-application. This way I can access
  this programm easily from my phone and from my desktop computer.

The first and only feature so far is to save expenses to a database. One expense has the following properties:

* **Description** of the expense, e.g. "Coffee",
* **Amount**,
* **Date** of spending and
* **Category** of the expense, e.g. "Groceries" or "Rent".

# TODO
* Implement security with username, password, individual databases etc
* Write tests for already existing code

# Ideas for further features
* Implement sub-categories
* Implement a dark-mode
* Make "Expring" text in webpage with Vollkorn typeface
